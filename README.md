# TicTacToe Multiplayer
Welcome to Tic Tac Toe, a cross-platform multiplayer game developed using Unreal Engine 5 and the EOS Plugin. This game allows players to connect and play Tic Tac Toe with friends across different platforms, including PC and Mobile. One player can host a game while the other joins, creating an exciting and competitive experience for everyone.


# Gameplay

In Tic Tac Toe Multiplayer, players take turns to place their respective marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to align three of your marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before your opponent does. The game ends when a player wins, or the board is filled, resulting in a draw. The winner is announced at the end, and a dedicated screen shows whether Player X or Player O won or if the game ended in a draw.

The game supports cross-platform play, meaning a PC player can host the game, and a mobile player can join in to compete.
